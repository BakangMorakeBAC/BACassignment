         <h1 style="font-style: bold;">THE HISTORY OF ROME</h1>
		 
		 <article>
         <section>
            
   <p style="font-style: bold;">Rome is the Capital city of Italy and its considered the heart of Italy but the Rome of today is not the sam rome as the rome of the past. Rome approximately 10,000 years ago history shows that there was a human presence and there were tools and weapons that were made of stone. Though the shocking thing is that the settlers were mostly pastoral farmers.
Over time this grew over centuries till the mid eighth century BC where the name Roma or Rome as we know this name today was born and its founder <u>King Romulus</u>. Then the question will arise in your mind. Who is King Romulus?. Well there is a legend about him whether or not is myth thats up to you. Well it is said Romulus had a twin brother named Remus, these twins suckled milk froma she-wolf.
One day the twins decided to build a city and once build they argued and Romulus killed his brother to take the city for himself. Since then Rome has been ruled in a monarchical system for a time of 244 years and during that time there has been 7 different kings being <i><b>Romulus, Numa Pompilius, Tullus Hostilius, Ancus Marcius, Tarquinius Priscus, Servius Tullius and Lucius Tarquinius Superbus.</b></i></p>

<p>In 509 BC, the Romans expelled the last king from their city and established an oligarchic republic. Rome then began a period characterised by internal struggles between patricians (aristocrats) and plebeians (small landowners), and by constant warfare against the populations of central Italy: Etruscans, Latins, Volsci, Aequi, and Marsi.After becoming master of Latium, Rome led several wars (against the Gauls, Osci-Samnites and the Greek colony of Taranto, allied with Pyrrhus, king of Epirus) whose result was the conquest of the Italian peninsula, from the central area up to Magna Graecia.</p>

<p> From the years that followed Rome build an an empire from king to king a stronger  and bigger the time for the birth of christ the roman empire and was tried and killed for
the crimes that were against the Rome</p>
